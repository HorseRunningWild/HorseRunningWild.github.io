## Too Young
**Have you ever had a time when you were full of self-importance but felt powerless?**

At least, that was always the case before I went to college. It wasn't all bad: I was ambitious, had an incredibly strong drive to act, was quite persistent about certain concepts, did some (what I thought were) good things, and also some foolish ones. In summary, the creed of my younger self was to uphold **"Passion"** and **"Kindness"**. Unfortunately, it wasn't easily understood by others, and often it ended up hurting me instead.

After the college entrance exam, I wrote a full-length novel composed of several novellas, recounting my childhood and middle school years. After all, an unexamined life is not worth living. I tried submitting my work several times, hoping in my heart to be discovered by a discerning editor, but each attempt ended in failure.

Times have changed, and now, almost transformed into a **straightforward STEM guy**, when I look back at my work from those days, on one hand, I marvel at the naivety, narrow-mindedness, and obstinacy of my mindset while writing. On the other hand, I am struck by the unique way I once viewed the world, which resulted in a peculiar style and core in my writing.

I have bid farewell to my past and feel no nostalgia for it whatsoever. However, my dear friend Tian Guanchen (majoring in Psychology at East China Normal University,`tianguanchen7@gmail.com`) is still full of curiosity about the things I wrote in the past. True to form for someone planning to pursue psychology his whole life. He inspired me with the question: does my former self still hold meaning for this world? This is a question I cannot answer and no longer intend to investigate.

It depends on You.I'm not sure if I should directly open-source all of my works; perhaps no one cares anyway. So, I need the readers' opinion on this matter. Feel free to send me an email with your thoughts.

## Getting Older
### Life Open Source Project
After entering university, I admit that while I have indeed shed my former arrogance and bias, I seem to have also developed tendencies towards selfishness and indifference. I hope that I can still maintain a sense of caring for others, which is **kindness**, as well as enthusiasm and pursuit for life, which is **passion**. Thus, I initiated the "Life Open Source Project" column.
