I'm a student of class of 2023 from [School of SPA](https://spa.sysu.edu.cn/), [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes Artificial Neural Network,Machine Learning,Brain Science.

But, of course, this is not the "academic personal homepage" intended for teachers, so I can still talk about interests beyond academia. For instance, I once considered myself a novelist (though self-proclaimed), and now I am a die-hard movie enthusiast, a fitness buff who works out or goes for long runs every day, and someone who is on the verge of becoming a half-wild hiker.

This personal homepage is an extension of my WeChat public account, which essentially does two things:
- Write stories about people I care about.
- Focus on algorithms, GPA, and research.

I do these things not for any particular purpose, but simply because I want to. I hope that what I care about can be of interest to others, that my reflections can provoke thought in others, and that what I learn can benefit everyone.
