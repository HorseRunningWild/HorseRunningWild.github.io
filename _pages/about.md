I'm a student of class of 2023 from [School of SPA](https://spa.sysu.edu.cn/), [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes Artificial Neural Network,Machine Learning,Brain Science.

But, of course, this is **NOT** the "academic personal homepage" intended for teachers, so I can still talk about interests beyond academia. For instance, I once considered myself a ~~novelist~~ (though self-proclaimed), and now I am a die-hard *movie enthusiast*, a *fitness buff* who works out or goes for long runs every day, and someone who is on the verge of becoming a half-wild *hiker*.To me, the **pursuit of my passions** and the ability to **cherish those I hold dear** are infinitely more significant than any accolades I might have received or any titles I might have held.

This personal homepage is an extension of my WeChat public account, which essentially does two things:
- Write stories about people I care about.
- Focus on algorithms, GPA, and research.

I do these things not for any particular purpose, but simply because I want to. I hope that what I care about can be of interest to others, that my reflections can provoke thought in others, and that what I learn can benefit everyone.

Well, if you're already tired of my ramblings and just want to get the materials quickly, then you can **click on the text** on the corresponding page to be redirected to my GitHub repository!

In addition, if you wish to collaborate with me or have any suggestions for improvement, please feel free to contact me directly!Just send E-mail to `j3540493668@outlook.com`.
